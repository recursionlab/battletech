# AI Integration Best Practices

Guidelines for integrating AI systems into existing workflows and applications.

## Core Principles

### 1. Incremental Integration
- Start with small, well-defined use cases
- Build proof of concepts before full implementation
- Measure impact at each stage

### 2. Data Quality First
- Ensure high-quality training data
- Implement validation and cleaning pipelines
- Monitor data drift over time

### 3. Human-AI Collaboration
- Design for human oversight
- Provide explainable AI outputs
- Maintain human decision authority for critical paths

## Implementation Patterns

### Augmentation Pattern
AI assists human decision-making without replacing human judgment.

### Automation Pattern  
AI handles routine tasks while humans focus on exceptions.

### Advisory Pattern
AI provides recommendations that humans can accept, modify, or reject.

## Risk Mitigation

- Implement fallback mechanisms
- Monitor for bias and fairness
- Establish clear boundaries for AI decision-making
- Regular model validation and retraining
