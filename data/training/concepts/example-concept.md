# Systems Thinking Fundamentals

Systems thinking is a holistic approach to analysis that focuses on the way that a system's constituent parts interrelate and how systems work over time and within the context of larger systems.

## Core Principles

1. **Holistic Perspective**: View the system as a whole rather than individual components
2. **Interconnectedness**: Understand relationships and dependencies between elements
3. **Purpose**: Every system exists for a purpose or function
4. **Non-linearity**: Small changes can have large effects (and vice versa)

## Key Components

### Elements
The individual parts or components of a system.

### Interconnections
The relationships that hold the elements together.

### Purpose
The function or goal of the system.

## Applications

- Business process improvement
- Software architecture design  
- Problem solving methodologies
- Organizational development
