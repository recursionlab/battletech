Recursive Symbolic Kernel for Cognition:
Theoretical Foundations and LLM Integration
Abstract
We propose a  recursive   symbolic   kernel   for   cognition  that unifies several advanced theoretical
frameworks to ground large language model (LLM) agents in a structured, self-referential semantic system.
This   kernel   combines  ∞-category   theory  (infinite-dimensional   category   structures)   with  recursive
distinction hierarchies (multi-level self-referential symbols) to formalize a deeply nested representation of
knowledge. It leverages topos theory to structure multiple logical contexts and manage information flow,
and integrates autopoietic cognition principles so that the kernel operates as a self-maintaining “living”
system. Insights from formal linguistics (e.g.  mathematical   language   structures  and  higher-order
abstract syntax) ensure that symbolic representations and embeddings align with language’s recursive
nature. Within this kernel, LLMs function as stochastic generative agents whose flat sequence predictions
are anchored to the kernel’s rich hierarchy of distinctions and meanings. We contrast the LLM’s surface-
level token generation with the kernel’s deep semantic lineage, grounding, and self-halting reasoning. The
result is an architectural model wherein the LLM’s probabilistic outputs are systematically interpreted,
constrained, and enriched by a robust semantic substrate – a step toward an AGI design that is both
capable and inherently aligned.
Core Theoretical Components
∞-Category   Theory   and   Recursive   Structure: ∞-category theory provides a foundation for modeling
hierarchical and self-referential structures in a principled way. In this framework, objects and morphisms
can themselves be higher-dimensional categories and functors, all existing within an “∞-cosmos” that
obeys a few axioms . This means we can treat entire categories of concepts or processes as single
nodes in a higher structure, and transformations between processes as higher-order morphisms. Such a
rich hierarchy is ideal for a cognition model that must handle  relations   between   relations   (meta-
relations)  and iterative self-reference. By leveraging ∞-categories, the kernel can host  categories of
cognitive processes and functors representing transitions between cognitive states, enabling the system to
reason about its own reasoning in a mathematically rigorous way. This aligns with the need for multi-level
distinction-making in intelligence: advanced intelligence arises from making distinctions about distinctions in
a hierarchy . Put simply, ∞-category theory supplies the formal language for “recursion on steroids” – a
way to encode an indefinite tower of self-similar cognitive structures.
Recursive   Distinction   Theory   &   Fixed-Point   Foundations:  Building on the category-theoretic view,
Recursive Distinction Theory (RDT) contributes a concrete insight: intelligence requires a minimal depth of
recursive   self-reference. RDT posits that a system must form distinctions about its own distinctions
through at least three levels to exhibit advanced cognition . At this third level, a fixed-point self-reference
emerges as a mathematical necessity , echoing Kleene’s Second Recursion Theorem in recursion theory
(which guarantees the existence of self-replicating/self-referencing programs). In category-theoretic terms,

applying a “distinction functor” three times yields an object that effectively refers to itself . This result is
supported by classic fixed-point theorems: for example, in computability and domain theory, any monotonic
recursive operator has a least fixed point – an outcome that formalizes self-consistency . Kleene’s
theorem and Lawvere’s diagonal argument ensure that self-referential elements can be constructed within
the system, providing a foundation for the kernel’s  self-model. In summary, RDT and recursion theory
enforce that the kernel’s symbolic structure must include a  three-layered recursive loop (distinction of a
distinction of a distinction) to achieve self-awareness and robust inferencing . This recursive
structure is not only the source of cognitive power but also of  intrinsic safety: RDT’s  Conservation   of
Relational Information (CRI) principle states that a closed cognitive system cannot create new information
without new input . In effect, the kernel has a built-in “thermodynamic”-like constraint (a second law of
cognition) that prevents runaway self-improvement from violating information limits . Likewise, the
Distinction Bottleneck Principle formalizes that preserving information-rich distinctions is necessary for
generalization capacity  – a principle that aligns the kernel’s design with the observed trade-off
between compression and generalization in AI. Together, these insights ensure the symbolic kernel is deep
enough to be intelligent but constrained enough to be stable.
Topos Theory for Symbolic Locality and Information Flow: Topos theory contributes the notion of a
unified logical space in which multiple contexts (or “worlds”) of discourse coexist, each with its own local
logic, yet all integrated by functors and natural transformations. The kernel leverages topos structures to
manage abstraction layers and modality. For instance, different cognitive domains – say, visual reasoning
vs. linguistic reasoning – can be treated as different internal logical subspaces of a single topos, each obeying
its own internal logic but connected to others via morphisms . A topos inherently has a rich internal
language (an intuitionistic higher-order logic) that the kernel uses to represent knowledge symbolically
while still accommodating uncertainty or varying truth (similar to sheaf models of contextual truth). This
framework excels at handling symbolic locality: each piece of information can be true in a local context (an
“open set” in a topos sense) and gluing conditions (sheaf conditions) ensure global consistency. Moreover,
topos theory is instrumental in describing how information flows between different representational
forms. In our model, it explains how to bridge the gap between symbolic discrete reasoning and continuous
probabilistic   reasoning.   Prior   work   in  Quantum   Toposophy  (topos   approaches   to   quantum   logic)
demonstrates that quantum probabilities and classical logic can be unified in a topos . By analogy,
the kernel uses a topos to unify  neural network probabilistic knowledge  with  symbolic logical structures.
Functorial mappings can carry quantum-like probabilistic information into logical inference models .
For example, an entangled state or a superposition (from a neural embedding) can be functorially mapped
to   a   distribution   over   symbolic   propositions,   enabling   non-classical,   context-dependent   inference.
Transitional Topologies in AI research suggests that AI’s internal knowledge could form a self-organizing
manifold of meanings within a topos, where categorical functors translate between neural embeddings,
symbolic   concepts,   and   probabilistic   contexts . In practical terms, this means the kernel can
accommodate an LLM’s vector-based knowledge as well as logical rules: the topos serves as a lingua franca
connecting sub-symbolic and symbolic representations. It provides structural notions like  dimensional
reduction (mapping high-dimensional continuous knowledge into lower-dimensional symbolic summaries)
and  holographic   encoding  (storing distributed information in structured forms) . All of this
supports the kernel’s ability to manage complexity: high-entropy, high-dimensional raw knowledge is
systematically funneled into structured, simpler representations akin to a renormalization process
. The topos-theoretic perspective thus ensures that the symbolic kernel is not monolithic or brittle: it is a
flexible, multi-layered space where different types of reasoning (logical, geometric, probabilistic) can all take
place and inform each other in a controlled way.

Autopoietic Cognition (Self-Production of Meaning): To truly ground symbols in a cognitive agent, the
kernel adopts  autopoietic   principles  from Maturana and Varela. An autopoietic system is one that
continuously produces and reproduces its own components, maintaining an identity (organizational closure)
separate from its environment. We treat the symbolic kernel as an  autopoietic subsystem: its core
distinctions, categories, and transformation rules are not static data structures, but actively regenerated
and adjusted through the system’s ongoing interactions. In this view, cognition is not mere computation
but a living process of self-maintenance. The kernel’s internal processes are designed to mirror a living
organism’s loop of perceiving, acting, and adapting in order to preserve its integrity. For example, the
distinctions that the system uses to classify inputs are continually re-affirmed or modified by a self-
referential loop, ensuring the system’s internal model stays cohesive and viable. This resonates with Info-
autopoiesis, the idea of  “self-production   of   information” . An info-autopoietic system doesn’t
passively receive data; it actively creates meaningful information by interpreting perturbations in terms of its
own internal distinctions. In the kernel, any external input (from sensors or an LLM’s suggestion) is
evaluated through existing distinctions (does it make a difference that makes a difference to the system?
) and either incorporated in a way that reinforces the system’s organization or triggers an adaptive
reorganization. Importantly, this autopoietic approach addresses the  symbol   grounding   problem: the
kernel’s symbols mean something to the system because they are bound up with the system’s continued
existence and goals. This aligns with Cárdenas-García’s point that current AI creations (like today’s LLMs) remain
purely syntactic and do not produce semantic information by themselves . All external expressions of
knowledge (e.g. text outputs) are just tokens until a living process interprets them. Thus, by embedding
autopoiesis, the kernel ensures that symbols and statements have consequences internally (affecting its state
or   prompting   further   action)   rather   than   being   free-floating   bits.   The   autopoietic   loop   includes
homeostatic mechanisms: borrowing from biology, if certain distinctions or goals start drifting, the system
detects the deviation and acts to restore balance. In essence, the symbolic kernel “owns” its information: it
decides what information to accept, how to structure it, and when to discard or transform it  to maintain
coherence. This makes the kernel robust to noise and able to operate autonomously, much like a living
cognitive organism rather than a static knowledge base. It also inherently limits the system: as Info-
autopoiesis argues, no matter how sophisticated our syntactic constructions, they cannot by themselves
produce semantic, living understanding . The kernel’s design acknowledges this by making the life-like
self-referential activity a core part of the architecture, not an afterthought. In practical terms, autopoiesis
in the kernel could be implemented as a continual feedback cycle where the system’s high-level goals and
self-model (encoded in the category/topos structure) modulate low-level perception and action, and vice
versa,  with  no  need  for  an  external  supervisor. This yields a form of  self-grounding: the system’s
representations are grounded in its own drive to preserve its cognitive consistency and achieve its goals in
its environment.
Language Structures and Higher-Order Syntax: Since our kernel must interface with natural language
(both for input/output and because the LLM agent thinks in language patterns), we incorporate formal
insights about linguistic structure. Mathematical Structures in Language show that natural languages possess
recursive syntactic structures and invariants that can be captured with mathematical rigor . For
instance, languages use  hierarchical   phrase   structures   (trees)  and exhibit properties like long-range
dependencies and coreference (anaphora) that follow structural rules. In our kernel, we represent the
internal “language of thought” in a way that mirrors these properties, ensuring that when the kernel
interprets or generates language, it does so in a structurally sound manner. One key idea is to treat the
kernel’s knowledge representation itself as a language with a compositional syntax and semantics (much
like formal grammar for sentences). Using the higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS) approach, the kernel’s
internal representations of rules and propositions leverage the host meta-language’s own function binding
