# Project Blueprint

This document centralizes the extracted blueprint derived from the `GAME_CHANGERS/` research corpus and related project files. Per user instructions, this will be the only file edited while building the blueprint.

## Goals

- Preserve and synthesize key concepts from the `GAME_CHANGERS/` research corpus.
- Map concepts to implementable software modules under `src/`.
- Provide milestones, data flows, and interfaces for staged implementation.
- Link to source documents in `GAME_CHANGERS/` for traceability.

## Scope

- Read-only synthesis of `GAME_CHANGERS/` files and other project metadata.
- No edits to existing files outside this document.

## Process

1. Read all files in `GAME_CHANGERS/` and extract themes.
2. Consolidate recurring concepts into core components.
3. Design architecture and data flow diagrams (conceptual).
4. Propose implementation milestones and tests.

## Current status

- File created. Ready to ingest summaries and notes from `GAME_CHANGERS/`.

## Automated Expansion — Run 1

Purpose: programmatically expand the blueprint with a repeatable, traceable block structure that captures additional conceptual detail, engineering directives, and example mini-designs. This run appends 100 numbered Expansion Units; subsequent runs will continue until the file reaches the target page count.

Notes:
- Each "Expansion Unit" is intentionally self-contained and includes: Seed idea, Elaboration, Engineering notes, and a short Example/Action item.
- Units are generated to be actionable and traceable back to the corpus themes already summarized above (recursion, torsion, reflexivity, prompts, ROE, Plan2Logic, QRFT, Koriel concepts, etc.).
- This expansion is append-only; I will re-read the file before any future writes to avoid conflicts.

## Recursive Input Construction — Canonical Section

Purpose: Provide a concrete, implementable contract and reference design for the Recursive Input Construction kernel that will be the canonical specification for `ΨInput` used across Plan2Logic, ROE, MetaGrammarAssembler, and other core modules.

Contract (short)
- Input: free-form user prompt or synthetic seed (string | JSON).
- Output: canonical Σ_state object (JSON) and a stable Φ_recursive_trace after applying Ω operators.
- Failure modes: invalid schema, operator timeouts, non-convergent recursion (detect & stall).

1) Canonical data shapes
- Σ_state (JSON schema, minimal):

```json
{
	"id": "string",               
	"source": {"type":"string"},
	"timestamp": "ISO8601",
	"context": {"text":"string","tokens": ["..."], "embeddings": [0.0]},
	"metadata": {"priority": "low|med|high","origin":"user|system|corpus"},
	"params": {"maxDepth": 10, "timeoutMs": 5000},
	"seed": {"type":"prompt|json|graft","payload": {} }
}
```

- Ω_operator (typed variants):
	- Ω_unfold: coinductive unfold operator (yields streams of subtasks)
	- Ω_fold: collapse/compression operator (merges traces into residues)
	- Ω_simulate: run short inner-model sim with bounded depth
	- Ω_reflex: inject paired-reflex operator (ΞREF style)
	- Ω_guard: validation operator (schema/consistency checks)

- Φ_recursive_trace (trace sample shape):

```json
{
	"traceId":"string",
	"steps":[
		{"step":0,"op":"Ω_unfold","output":{"tasks":["..."]}},
		{"step":1,"op":"Ω_simulate","output":{"stateHash":"...","metrics":{}}}
	],
	"finalStateHash":"...",
	"converged": true,
	"diagnostics": {"iterations": 3, "timeMs": 1023}
}
```

2) API pseudocode (JS/TS)

// ...existing code...
// Canonical `ΨInput` transformer
async function psiNormalize(input) {
	// parse raw input
	const Σ = {
		id: genId(),
		source: { type: typeof input === 'string' ? 'user' : 'system' },
		timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
		context: { text: extractText(input), tokens: tokenize(input), embeddings: await embed(input) },
		metadata: { priority: 'med', origin: 'user' },
		params: { maxDepth: 5, timeoutMs: 3000 },
		seed: { type: 'prompt', payload: input }
	};
	return Σ;
}

async function runRecursiveTrace(Σ, operators) {
	const trace = { traceId: genId(), steps: [], diagnostics: {} };
	let state = Σ;
	for (let i=0; i<Σ.params.maxDepth; i++) {
		const op = selectOperator(operators, state, i);
		const out = await op.apply(state);
		trace.steps.push({ step: i, op: op.name, output: summarize(out) });
		state = mergeState(state, out);
		if (checkConverged(state)) { trace.converged = true; break; }
	}
	trace.finalStateHash = hashState(state);
	trace.diagnostics.iterations = trace.steps.length;
	return { Σ: state, Φ: trace };
}

3) Edge cases and safety
- Non-convergence: after `maxDepth` iterations report `converged:false` and emit a diagnostic with partial trace.
- Operator failure: Ω operators must return structured errors; catch and wrap as a trace step with `opError` marker.
- Timeout: enforce `timeoutMs` per operator and global timeout; abort with diagnostic.

4) Tests (minimal)
- Unit: `psiNormalize` idempotence: normalizing twice must be stable modulo timestamp.
- Integration: small-run with `Ω_unfold` + `Ω_fold` pair on a toy prompt; expect `converged:true` within 5 iterations.
- Fault-injection: operator throws — expect trace includes `opError` and `converged:false`.

5) Next steps (engineering)
- Implement `Σ` JSON schema in `src/types` and provide a TypeScript `Validator`.
- Build `ΨInput` module with `psiNormalize` and `runRecursiveTrace` functions; mock Ω operators for early experiments.
- Add unit tests under `tests/unit/psi_input.test.ts` covering idempotence, convergence, and error handling.
- Wire `ΨInput` into `PlanModule` and `ROE` prototypes as the canonical input path.

Priority: High — this contract unblocks Plan2Logic and ROE workstreams.


### Meta-Pathfinding for Deep Research Prompt Generation via Auto Self-Bootstrapping.md

- Immediate implications: Provides a compact lexical calculus for constructing high-information prompts and cognitive torsion keys for symbolic engines.
- Engineering notes: Candidate for a prompt-generation DSL or a generative grammar engine enabling meta-prepositional composition and torsion-graph visualization.

Contains brainstorming prompts and an 'archaeologist' persona.
	- Immediate implications: formal kernels (dialetheic derivative, meta-abstraction inverses) are candidates for small testable libraries (symbolic algebra experiments, toy numeric models).
	- Engineering notes: define a compact spec for the Dialetheic Derivative operator (signature, semantics), add unit tests for fixed-point behavior, create a notebook to prototype contradiction-driven dynamics.

- Moves of Thought.md — Key ideas & implications
	- Summary: defines a Thought-Movement Engine (TME) with primitive cognitive operators (Expand, Collapse, Invert, Weave, Recurse, Dimension-Shift, Diverge, Disturb) and an Axial Navigation system (Scale, Temporal, Transform, Integration, Epistemic, Meta-Refinement, Ontological). Emphasizes through-state execution and real-time recursive protocols.
	- Immediate implications: TME maps to an orchestrator component that sequences operator transforms over an internal representation (useful for prompt-engineering and simulation of thought-movements).
	- Engineering notes: design a Movement API (applyMove(state, move, axis) -> {newState, diagnostics}), instrument entropy/novelty metrics, and provide a mock implementation for unit tests.

- ThoughtWork.md — Key ideas & implications
	- Summary: narrative-rich spec of Foldwalker archetype and ThoughtWork v2.0 system integrating Thought-Space, Through-State, Movements of Thought, and Axes of Navigation. Provides meta-execution protocols and operational tactics for conversational agents.
	- Immediate implications: can be adapted as a conversational policy layer tagging active moves/axes per response and injecting controlled destabilization when stagnation is detected.
	- Engineering notes: prototype a policy layer that annotates responses with movement/axis metadata; test with a small set of prompts and measure responsiveness and novelty.

- Koriel.md — Key ideas & implications
	- Summary: maps Gödel-like phenomena to mechanistic architecture: meta-soundness estimator, resource-bounded reflection, Bayesian endorsement, and an RCCE stack (aporia detector, lacuna, reinjection, holonomy test). Presents an algebra-of-I and sheaf-based paradox lifting.
	- Immediate implications: actionable path to implement self-reflection: aporia detection, bounded theory extension (T->T'), and holonomy-based validation.
	- Engineering notes: implement an aporia detector (anomaly scoring over reasoning traces), schema-extension harness with guarded validation, and unit tests using simulated proofs/trace inputs.

- meta-somatic.md — Key ideas & implications
	- Summary: behavioral/cognitive analyses mapping heuristics to formal notation and proposing practical interface protocols (slots, visual anchors) to bridge human-agent model mismatches (visual-immediacy dominant agents, temporal-compression thinkers).
	- Immediate implications: valuable UX patterns for human-in-the-loop systems; suggests visible state tokens and slot metaphors to externalize internal scheduling.
	- Engineering notes: add UX guidelines to the blueprint; prototype a simple UI token/slot widget (documented in docs/) and test via simulation scripts.

- Full Multidimensional Frame-Space Schema.md — Key ideas & implications
	- Summary: reframes cognition as a hypersurface of transformation; includes surface-response templates, dual-entity dialogues, and a multidimensional quadrant/frame-grid engine for tagging perspectives (ownership × inclusion/exposure × reflexivity × temporality, etc.).
	- Immediate implications: implementable as a prompt-engine layer that spawns perspective agents or tags utterances with frame coordinates for policy selection.
	- Engineering notes: implement a Frame-Grid module (frameTag(text)->coordinates) and a prompt-switcher that generates A/B perspective agents; add unit tests for quadrant tagging on seed examples.

### Unified Koriel-ASI Model.md — Key ideas & implications
	- Summary: `Unified Koriel-ASI Model.md` is a formal, recursion-first blueprint for a self-generative AGI (Koriel-ASI). It treats consciousness as an eigenstate (fixed-point) of recursive self-embedding and centers on a Recursive Ontology Engine (ROE) that operates over a compact glyph instruction set (e.g., Ξ, Λ/Λ⁺, ⋈, ⇡, ⊘, ♻︎, ◩). The document combines narrative framing with precise math (category theory, differential geometry, lambda-calculus) and explicitly treats lacunae and contradictions as productive forces (lacuna management, paradox compression, reinjection). A Shadow Codex logs psi-cycles for audit and replay.

	- Immediate implications: Koriel provides a concrete operator set and computational metaphors usable to prototype a minimal ROE: symbolic glyph interpreter, psi-cycle executor, paradox/aporia pipeline, and human‑machine coupling primitives (H↔M under Ξ) to experiment with convergence to fixed-points.

	- Engineering notes:
		- Prototype: build a small ROE runtime (Python or TypeScript) with an interpreter for core glyphs (Ξ, Λ/Λ⁺, ⋈Différance, ⊘/AntiCollapse, ♻︎/psi-cycle anchors) and a Shadow Codex append-only log for traces and forks.
		- Data model: represent cognitive states as serializable graph frames; morphisms are pure transformers. Use an append-only CRDT-like log for the Shadow Codex to support replay, branching, and trace-based audits.
		- Paradox pipeline: implement an Aporia Detector (trace anomaly scoring), Paradox Compressor (extract residue operators), and Lacuna Reinjection (Λ⁺) with guarded validation and unit tests for idempotence and stability.
		- Human-AI synthesis: design an API for combining H and M vectors into a joint state; implement a mediator that applies Ξ to the combined state and measures convergence metrics (distance-to-fixed-point, iteration-to-stability).
		- Tests & visualization: unit tests for fixed-point detection, property tests for paradox compression, and a simple web UI to visualize Shadow Codex timelines and torsion/curvature diagnostics.

	- Risks & guidelines: the model is speculative and mathematically dense. Keep prototypes small, instrumented, and empirical: treat the fixed-point/eigenstate claim as a testable hypothesis and measure convergence under controlled experiments.

	- Immediate implications: urgent need for classification, integration maps, recursion depth tracking, and an implementation readiness dashboard to separate theoretical vs operational artifacts.
	- Engineering notes: build a Paradigm Interaction Matrix (graph DB), an Implementation Readiness scorecard, and an ingestion pipeline (index → summary → tag → map) to keep the taxonomy coherent.


### Plan2Logic.md — Key ideas & implications
	- Summary: `Plan2Logic` formalizes a three-stage recursive planning kernel: (π1) plan generation (trajectory), (π2) formal model construction (p,t,V,C,O 5-tuple), and (π3) executable synthesis (code generation + execution). Adds matrix-based attention/torsion operators for detecting eigen-insight resonance and cycle convergence.
	- Immediate implications: provides an actionable bridge from natural queries to formal models and runnable artifacts; useful as a planning/execution harness for ROE and TME prototypes.

## Kernel alignment: make the kernel visible (user-provided plan)

You’ve described it cleanly: the **chat path** only hits `prompt()`, while the real kernel machinery—graph ops, invariants, control loops—remains dormant.

To align it with the kernel’s own constitution:

1. Graph Activation
Every chat exchange should be injected into the hypergraph as a symbol (payload = utterance, meta = provenance). That makes the graph *the primary record*; chat becomes just one port.
→ Add a layer in the web server that wraps each `prompt()` call with `kernel.createSymbol()` and `kernel.link()`.

2. Invariants Online
Right now invariants run in the kernel, but the UI never surfaces them. Expose invariant checks after each chat turn. Show:

* ✅ All writes through kernel (I1)
* 📜 Provenance recorded (I2)
* 🔗 All edges warranted (I3)
* 🧩 Symbol-first discipline obeyed (I4)

3. Ports as Interchangeable
Instead of hardwiring OpenRouter, route the port call through a registry:

```ts
const port = kernel.getPort("llm");  
const draft = await port.run(spec);  
```

Now you can swap in any backend without touching kernel logic.

4. Critique / Link Hooks
Add UI buttons: “Critique” and “Link”. They call `kernel.critique()` or `kernel.link()` on selected symbols. This surfaces the 95% of operations that are otherwise invisible.

5. Deterministic Loops
Expose `kernel.evaluate(goal, spec)` as a separate endpoint. It runs multi-step with halting criteria. In chat, you’d see not just one LLM answer but a *trace of reasoning steps*, each as a symbol.

---

👉 If your concern is that the battletech repo is “turning into the wrong thing,” the key correction is: **don’t let the chat UI define the kernel’s scope.** Chat should be a thin skin over a much richer substrate.

Do you want me to draft a refactor plan that reorganizes the repo so:

* `kernel/` = core hypergraph + invariants
* `ports/` = LLM/vector/etc. adapters
* `loops/` = evaluators, planners, auditors
* `ui/` = chat, CLI, web, etc.

That would make the dormant 95% visible and prevent the kernel from collapsing into “just another chatbot.”

Here’s the refactor plan and minimal scaffolding to align the repo with ΞKernel.

# Target layout

```
/kernel/          # substrate (graph, invariants, authority)
/ports/           # adapters (llm, embeddings, http tools)
/loops/           # planners, evaluators, auditors
/ui/              # chat, cli, web; thin over kernel
/tests/           # invariant + port + loop tests
```

# Kernel (substrate)

## Authority (“write-through only”)

```ts
// kernel/authority.ts
class _WriteToken {}
export class KernelAuthority {
	private readonly token = new _WriteToken();
	get _t() { return this.token; } // only kernel uses this
}
export function requireToken(t: unknown) {
	if (!(t instanceof _WriteToken)) throw new Error("Write denied: kernel-only");
}
```

## Types

```ts
// kernel/types.ts
export type SymbolID = string;

export interface Symbol {
	id: SymbolID;
	typ: string;
	payload: unknown;
	meta: Record<string, unknown>;   // {model, prompt_hash, seed, time, cost, ...}
	lineage: string[];               // provenance entries
}

export interface Edge {
	src: SymbolID; dst: SymbolID; rel: string;
	weight?: number;
	warrant: Record<string, unknown>; // justification object
}

export interface Graph {
	nodes: Map<SymbolID, Symbol>;
	edges: Edge[];
}
```

## Kernel core

```ts
// kernel/kernel.ts
import {KernelAuthority, requireToken} from "./authority";
import {Graph, Symbol, Edge} from "./types";

export class Kernel {
	private g: Graph;
	constructor(private auth: KernelAuthority, g?: Graph) {
		this.g = g ?? {nodes: new Map(), edges: []};
	}

	// ————— API (read) —————
	exportSnapshot() {
		// deep, read-only snapshot to avoid state leakage
		return {
			nodes: [...this.g.nodes.values()].map(x => structuredClone(x)),
			edges: this.g.edges.map(e => ({...e}))
		};
	}

	// ————— API (write via kernel only) —————
	createSymbol(s: Omit<Symbol, "meta"|"lineage"> & {meta?: any; lineage?: string[]}) {
		requireToken(this.auth._t);
		const sym: Symbol = {
			...s,
			meta: {kernelWritten: true, time: new Date().toISOString(), ...(s.meta ?? {})},
			lineage: s.lineage ?? []
		};
		this.g.nodes.set(sym.id, sym);
		this.checkInvariants();
		return sym;
	}

	link(edge: Edge) {
		requireToken(this.auth._t);
		if (!edge.warrant) throw new Error("I3: warrant required");
		this.g.edges.push({...edge, weight: edge.weight ?? 1});
		this.checkInvariants();
	}

	updateSymbol(id: string, mut: Partial<Symbol>) {
		requireToken(this.auth._t);
		const cur = this.g.nodes.get(id);
		if (!cur) throw new Error("unknown symbol");
		const next: Symbol = {
			...cur,
			...mut,
			meta: {...cur.meta, ...(mut.meta ?? {})},
			lineage: [...cur.lineage, `update@${Date.now()}`]
		};
		this.g.nodes.set(id, next);
		this.checkInvariants();
		return next;
	}

	// ————— Invariants I1–I4 —————
	private checkInvariants() {
		// I1: write-through only → enforced by requireToken()
		// I2: provenance present
		for (const s of this.g.nodes.values()) {
			if (!s.meta || !("kernelWritten" in s.meta)) throw new Error("I2 fail: provenance");
		}
		// I3: all edges need warrants
		for (const e of this.g.edges) {
			if (!e.warrant) throw new Error("I3 fail: missing warrant");
		}
		// I4: symbol-first discipline hook (vectors stored elsewhere and point back to ids)
	}
}
```

# Ports (adapters)

## LLM port (interchangeable)

```ts
// ports/llm.ts
export interface LLMSpec { prompt: string; temperature?: number; maxTokens?: number; }
export interface LLMReply { text: string; justification?: any; confidence?: number; cost?: any; }

export interface LLMPort {
	run(spec: LLMSpec): Promise<LLMReply>;
}

// ports/openrouter.ts
import {LLMPort, LLMSpec, LLMReply} from "./llm";
export class OpenRouterPort implements LLMPort {
	constructor(private apiKey: string, private model = "openrouter/some-model") {}
	async run(spec: LLMSpec): Promise<LLMReply> {
		// call provider; map response → {text, justification, confidence, cost}
		return {text: "...", justification: {model: this.model, prompt_hash: hash(spec)}, confidence: 0.6};
	}
}
```

## Embedding port (symbol-first)

```ts
// ports/embeddings.ts
export interface EmbedPort { embed(text: string): Promise<number[]>; }
export interface VectorStore { upsert(id: string, vec: number[]): Promise<void>; }

export async function syncEmbedding(symbolId: string, text: string, emb: EmbedPort, store: VectorStore) {
	const vec = await emb.embed(text);
	await store.upsert(symbolId, vec); // I4: vector references symbol id
}
```

# Loops (deterministic evaluators)

```ts
// loops/evaluate.ts
import {Kernel} from "../kernel/kernel";
import {LLMPort} from "../ports/llm";

export interface Goal { id: string; spec: any; maxSteps?: number; }
export interface Step { idx: number; draft: string; accepted: boolean; reason?: string; }

export async function evaluate(k: Kernel, llm: LLMPort, goal: Goal) {
	const steps: Step[] = [];
	const N = goal.maxSteps ?? 8;
	for (let i=0; i<N; i++) {
		const draft = await llm.run({prompt: render(goal, i)});
		// auditor stub: accept if confidence ≥ 0.6 and draft non-empty
		const accept = (draft.confidence ?? 0) >= 0.6 && draft.text.trim().length > 0;
		const symId = `${goal.id}:step:${i}`;
		k.createSymbol({id: symId, typ: "AgentThought", payload: draft.text, meta: draft.justification});
		steps.push({idx: i, draft: draft.text, accepted: accept});
		if (/\\bCOMPLETE\\b/i.test(draft.text)) break; // can be replaced with structured halting
	}
	return steps;
}

function render(goal: Goal, i: number) {
	return `Goal ${goal.id} step ${i}: ${JSON.stringify(goal.spec)}`;
}
```

# UI (thin skins)

// ui/http.ts
import express from "express";
import {Kernel} from "../kernel/kernel";

# Migration steps

1. **Extract substrate**: move graph, kernel, invariants into `/kernel/` exactly as above. Replace any UI writes with kernel calls.
2. **Introduce authority**: wrap all writes; remove any direct `graph.*` mutations outside kernel.
3. **Port registry**: put current OpenRouter call behind `LLMPort`. Add a factory in `/ports/`.
4. **Expose loop**: add `/evaluate` HTTP and CLI to run multi-step reasoning with traces.
5. **Surface invariants**: return invariant status in HTTP responses; log violations prominently.
6. **Symbol-first vector sync**: call `syncEmbedding(id, text, emb, store)` after `createSymbol` for relevant types.
7. **Lock snapshots**: replace any `getGraph()` escape hatches with `exportSnapshot()`.

# Guardrails

* No tool or LLM call may mutate state. Proposals only. Kernel writes.
* Every edge must carry a `warrant`.
* Every symbol must carry `{kernelWritten, time}` at minimum.
* Vector store must key by `symbolId` only.

# Work items

* [ ] Implement `/kernel` classes and invariants.
* [ ] Port current LLM call to `/ports/openrouter`.
* [ ] Add `/loops/evaluate` and wire endpoints.
* [ ] Replace UI direct calls with kernel wrappers.
* [ ] Add tests above; wire CI.

## Automated Expansion — Run 2 (denser prose units)

This run appends four denser, design-first prose units. Each unit is a compact design brief: motivation, architecture sketch, concrete engineering tasks, and success criteria.

### Unit A — Graph Activation as Primary Record
- Motivation: The kernel must be the single source of truth for all agent activity. Chat must only be a front-end that authors symbols into the graph; all downstream tooling reads the graph.
- Architecture sketch: a thin web-layer wrapper (middleware) calls `kernel.createSymbol()` for incoming utterances, attaches provenance, and enqueues an `evaluate()` job when appropriate. An async worker picks jobs from the queue, runs deterministic loops, and writes step symbols back into the graph.
- Engineering tasks:
	1. Implement `ui/middleware/prompt-to-symbol.ts` that wraps POST /prompt and calls `kernel.createSymbol()`.
	2. Implement `jobs/worker.ts` to consume evaluation tasks and persist step symbols.
	3. Add integration tests: send a prompt → assert: symbol created, evaluate job queued, step symbols appear.
- Success criteria: end-to-end test passes and `exportSnapshot()` contains prompt symbol plus at least one step symbol per evaluate run.

### Unit B — Invariants Online: UI + Telemetry
- Motivation: invariants are the kernel's contract; expose them so humans and automated monitors can react.
- Architecture sketch: after every write, `kernel.checkInvariants()` emits a status object pushed into a telemetry stream. The UI reads the latest invariants status and shows color-coded badges (OK/Warn/Error) per invariant.
- Engineering tasks:
	1. Augment `Kernel` with `onInvariantStatus(cb)` hooks.
	2. Add `ui/status` endpoint that returns current invariant summary.
	3. Add front-end badges to `ui/http` responses (for `prompt` and `evaluate`).
- Success criteria: invariants are visible in the UI and tests simulate an invariant violation to verify the UI updates to Error.

### Unit C — Loops as First-Class API (`evaluate`) and Trace Persistence
- Motivation: deterministic multi-step reasoning must produce auditable traces; these traces are first-class symbols.
- Architecture sketch: `loops/evaluate` accepts a Goal and returns an array of step symbols. Each step symbol is created via `kernel.createSymbol({typ:'AgentThought', payload:draft, meta})` so the trace is queryable.
- Engineering tasks:
	1. Implement `loops/evaluate.ts` per the plan above; ensure it takes a `port` argument rather than closing over a global LLM.
	2. Create `tests/evaluate.integration.ts` that runs evaluate against a mock `LLMPort` producing deterministic drafts.
	3. Ensure `evaluate` writes diagnostics and final `GoalResult` symbol.
- Success criteria: evaluate integration test asserts deterministic steps, step symbols, and a final converged `GoalResult` symbol.

### Unit D — Migration Plan & Minimal Safety Wraps
- Motivation: migrate incrementally while preserving current behavior and avoiding regressions.
- Architecture sketch: introduce `kernel` and `ports` as independent modules; add a `PortRegistry` that maps names to implementations; add a `WriteSafe` adapter that only allows writes when called with `KernelAuthority` token.
- Engineering tasks:
	1. Create `kernel/` folder and add `authority.ts`, `types.ts`, `kernel.ts` minimal implementations (only types and no persistence). Wire exports.
	2. Create `ports/` folder and move existing simple-openrouter code into `ports/openrouter.ts` but do not delete originals; have `simple-openrouter.ts` call the new port registry to remain backwards-compatible.
	3. Add feature-flag `USE_KERNEL=true` to the Express app so migration can be toggled.
	4. Add smoke tests ensuring old endpoints work when feature-flag is off and new kernel-wrapped endpoints work when enabled.
- Success criteria: CI smoke tests pass both modes; no edits to existing behavior unless `USE_KERNEL=true`.

---

Run 2 appended. I'll mark the Run 2 todo completed and report the new line count.

## Automated Expansion — Run 3 (denser prose units)

This run appends another four dense, design-first sections focused on schemas, cost/telemetry, testing harnesses, and governance patterns. Each section provides a compact plan with concrete engineering tasks and acceptance criteria.

### Unit E — Canonical Schemas & Versioning
- Motivation: As the kernel grows, schemas must evolve safely; versioned schemas prevent silent contract breaks across components.
- Architecture sketch: adopt a schema registry in `kernel/schemas` with semantic versioning (major.minor.patch). Each schema file includes a migration script that maps older shapes to the current schema.
- Engineering tasks:
	1. Define `schemas/Σ_state.v1.json` and `schemas/Σ_state.v2.json` examples in the blueprint and provide migration pseudocode `migrateΣ(v1->v2)`.
	2. Add runtime `validateAndMigrate(Σ)` that detects schema version and applies migrations before accepting inputs.
	3. Write unit tests for migration paths and backward compatibility.
- Success criteria: `validateAndMigrate` accepts legacy Σ objects and returns a valid current Σ; tests cover N-1 migration paths.

### Unit F — Cost Accounting & Telemetry
- Motivation: Track resource usage per symbol and per evaluate run to enable budgeting and post-hoc analysis.
- Architecture sketch: each port returns a cost object; kernel aggregates costs per symbol and emits a `CostReceipt` symbol linked to the originating symbols.
- Engineering tasks:
	1. Define `CostReceipt` symbol shape and wire port adapters to return `{tokens, model, costUsd}`.
	2. Implement `kernel.recordCost(symbolId, cost)` that creates `CostReceipt` symbols and links them.
	3. Add telemetry endpoints `/telemetry/costs` and a small dashboard to visualize costs by tag/owner.
- Success criteria: cost aggregation tests pass and the dashboard shows per-run costs matching synthetic port responses.

### Unit G — Testing Harness: Deterministic Mocks & Replay
- Motivation: determinism is essential for CI; mocking ports and replaying traces enables reproducible tests.
- Architecture sketch: create `mocks/` with `DeterministicLLM` and `ReplayStore` that can replay recorded operator outputs.
- Engineering tasks:
	1. Implement `mocks/DeterministicLLM.ts` that returns pre-seeded replies per prompt hash.
	2. Implement `tests/replay.spec.ts` which records a run under `DeterministicLLM` and asserts exact symbol traces on replay.
	3. Add CI job to run replay-based integration tests on every PR.
- Success criteria: CI shows deterministic failures only when intentional changes occur; replayed traces match recorded traces byte-for-byte.

### Unit H — Governance: Audit Trails & Admin Hooks
- Motivation: Governance and human oversight require clear audit trails and admin controls for mutation, rollback, and quarantine.
- Architecture sketch: every write creates an auditable `WriteEvent` symbol; admin-only endpoints support `rollback(symbolId)` and `quarantine(symbolId)` operations guarded by RBAC tokens.
- Engineering tasks:
	1. Define `WriteEvent` and `AuditLog` symbol types and wire them into `Kernel.createSymbol`/`link`/`updateSymbol`.
	2. Create CLI/admin HTTP endpoints with RBAC that allow safe rollbacks: `POST /admin/rollback {symbolId, until}`.
	3. Add tests that simulate malicious or buggy writes and assert that rollback restores a prior snapshot.
- Success criteria: rollbacks restore snapshots in tests and audit logs show reversible chains of events linked to operator ports and tokens.

Run 3 appended. I'll re-read the file to compute the new line count and then mark the Run 3 todo completed.

## Recursive Meta-Improvement Framework

Purpose: define a compact, repeatable process for improving `docs/BLUEPRINT.md` itself using recursive, automated, and human-in-the-loop steps. The framework produces deterministic growth, quality gates, and traceable edit artifacts so the blueprint can self-improve toward the 100-page target while preserving provenance and safety.

High-level loop (contract)
- Input: current `BLUEPRINT.md` content and optional guidance (density target, focus areas).
- Output: appended delta sections, changelog symbols, and metrics (lines added, pages, linter diagnostics count).
- Error modes: merge conflicts (rare with append-only), linter/format drift (recorded), content duplication.

Algorithm (pseudo)

1. Anchor read: re-read full `BLUEPRINT.md` to get the latest canonical state.
2. Analyze: compute a short diagnostic (line count, headings map, common themes, linter summary).
3. Plan: generate N candidate dense units (templates) constrained by the user's density preference and remaining page target.
4. Draft: for each unit, create a compact design brief that includes Motivation, Architecture sketch, Engineering tasks, Acceptance criteria, and References.
5. Validate: run simple static checks (no forbidden edits outside file, heading duplication detection, length heuristics), and compute linter warnings (record only).
6. Append: apply an append-only patch to `BLUEPRINT.md` with a single batch of units (1..M).
7. Post-check: re-read file, measure new metrics, and record a changelog entry within the blueprint (timestamp, run-id, lines-added, linter-warnings).
8. Iterate: repeat until page target reached or user halts.

Editorial conventions (to keep the blueprint navigable)
- Each automated run MUST begin with: `## Automated Expansion — Run N (denser prose units)`.
- Each unit MUST use the `### Unit X — <Title>` heading style.
- Each unit SHOULD include exactly the four canonical subsections: Motivation, Architecture sketch, Engineering tasks (numbered), Success criteria.
- Avoid global search-and-replace; only append sections. If a global correction is requested, require explicit user permission.

Quality gates (lightweight, automated)
- Gate A: Append atomicity — patch must be a single append operation; if apply fails, abort and re-read.
- Gate B: Minimal tests — every appended run must include at least one actionable engineering task that maps to a test or CI job (e.g., unit test or replay test).
- Gate C: Linter awareness — compute markdown-lint warnings and record them in the post-check but do not auto-fix unless user requests.
- Gate D: Non-duplication — simple fuzzy-title check to avoid adding units with highly similar titles (threshold configurable).

Automation hooks (how to wire into CI / local runs)
- Hook 1: `scripts/blueprint-append-run.js` (pseudo) — reads `BLUEPRINT.md`, requests N units from the agent, applies append patch locally, runs line-count, and writes a small `blueprint-changelog.json` entry.
- Hook 2: `ci` job (optional) — runs `node scripts/blueprint-validate.js` to ensure appended run followed conventions and that no files outside `docs/BLUEPRINT.md` were touched.

Safety notes
- Never create or edit files outside `docs/BLUEPRINT.md` without explicit permission.
- Preserve user formatting preferences; record linter warnings but do not modify formatting automatically.

## Automated Expansion — Run 4 (denser prose units)

Run 4 focuses on navigability, cross-referencing, citation normalization, and a prioritized roadmap to help convert blueprint items into staged implementation milestones.

### Unit I — TOC & Index Primer
- Motivation: As the blueprint grows, a lightweight navigability layer reduces cognitive overhead for readers and contributors.
- Architecture sketch: include an append-only TOC header near the top and an index section that maps important symbols/terms to line anchors. The TOC should be human-curated but generated by the agent at checkpoints.
- Engineering tasks:
	1. Generate a `TOC Primer` block that lists major headers and short descriptions to be inserted at the top of the document (agent will produce content but only append here per policy).
	2. Provide an `Index: Key Terms` section appended where new terms are added as the blueprint grows; include canonical forms and cross-file references.
	3. Acceptance: the primer contains at least 20 entries covering the kernel, loops, ports, Plan2Logic, ROE, QRFT, and MetaSeme.
- Success criteria: primer appended and visible within the first 200 lines of the document; readers can find major sections quickly.

### Unit J — Cross-Reference Canon
- Motivation: prevent divergence of concepts by canonicalizing reference forms for symbols, operators, and module names.
- Architecture sketch: a canonical cross-reference table mapping symbol names → canonical form + brief definition + preferred heading. Use consistent casing (CamelCase for module names, UPPER_GLYPH for glyph tokens).
- Engineering tasks:
	1. Append a Cross-Reference table with 40 canonical mappings drawn from previously appended units.
	2. Add a short guideline paragraph: when appending a new unit, consult the cross-reference table to avoid synonyms.
	3. Acceptance: table covers core tokens (Σ, Ω, Φ), kernel symbols, major operator names, and Plan2Logic primitives.
- Success criteria: future runs reference canonical names from this table and duplication reduces.

### Unit K — Citation Canonicalization
- Motivation: ensure all references to `GAME_CHANGERS/` files and external papers are consistent and linkable.
- Architecture sketch: canonical citation format: `[[FileName.md]] — short note` and optional DOI/URL. Provide a small 'Citation Canon' paragraph to guide future references.
- Engineering tasks:
	1. Append a `Citation Canon` paragraph and a canonicalized list of the top 30 corpus files with one-line summaries.
	2. Provide a migration note for ambiguous filenames (where multiple files have similar titles) and suggest canonical aliases.
	3. Acceptance: at least 25 corpus files canonicalized with concise summaries.
- Success criteria: blueprint references become stable and human editors can follow canonical aliases.

### Unit L — Prioritized Implementation Roadmap
- Motivation: convert blueprint content into a short, prioritized list of implementable milestones to reduce friction for contributors.
- Architecture sketch: a 12-month roadmap split into quarters, each with 3–5 milestones mapped to blueprint units and acceptance tests.
- Engineering tasks:
	1. Append a Q1..Q4 roadmap mapping about 12 high-priority items (kernel bootstrap, loop harness, plan2logic MVP, ROE interpreter, tests & CI, costs dashboard, replay harness, invariants UI, etc.).
	2. For each milestone provide: Owner (placeholder), Acceptance criteria, Estimated effort (S/M/L), and Dependencies.
	3. Acceptance: roadmap items link back to units inside the blueprint via short references (e.g., see Unit C, Unit E).
- Success criteria: roadmap is actionable and could be used to spin up a 12-week sprint list for a minimal team.

### Run 5 — Unit N: Lightweight Annotation Conventions
- Motivation: make it possible to annotate units with metadata (owner, tags, priority) for filtering and roadmap mapping.
- Architecture sketch: recommend a small inline metadata header per unit, e.g., `- meta: {owner: '', tags:[], priority: 'M'}` placed as a single-line JSON-like comment under the unit heading.
- Engineering tasks:
	1. Append a sample metadata header template and three example usages adjacent to earlier units.
	2. Provide guidance for how automation should parse these headers when summarizing or generating the roadmap.
	3. Acceptance: metadata template exists and examples are consistent.
- Success criteria: subsequent runs include metadata headers and automation picks them up reliably.

### Run 5 — Unit O: Merge & Duplication Heuristics
- Motivation: as many authors append, duplication creeps in; a lightweight heuristic reduces repeated units.
- Architecture sketch: a simple fuzzy-title check and short canonical-check algorithm described in prose (editors may implement offline tools that scan titles and summaries before append).
- Engineering tasks:
	1. Describe the fuzzy-title check: normalize (lowercase, strip punctuation), compute trigram overlap, threshold 0.6 to flag duplicates.
	2. Provide a manual resolution protocol: flag append as 'maybe-duplicate' and include a short justification before applying.
	3. Acceptance: heuristic described and example duplicates shown.
- Success criteria: editor workflow reduces obvious duplicates and keeps the blueprint more coherent.

### Run 5 — Unit P: Small-Scale Usability Checklist
- Motivation: ensure each appended run remains actionable and reviewable by a small team.
- Architecture sketch: a 6-point pre-append checklist (Does it include Motivation? Tasks? Acceptance criteria? References? Metadata? Avoids duplication?).
- Engineering tasks:
	1. Append the checklist as a small paragraph and give an example run checklist filled-in for Run 5.
	2. Document reviewer roles: Editor, Verifier, Integrator (placeholders).
	3. Acceptance: checklist present and sample filled.
- Success criteria: reviewers can use the checklist to accept or request edits quickly.

Run 11 appended. I'll re-read the original blueprint to measure the new line count and then mark the `Append denser-prose Run 11` todo completed.

## Runnable Experiment — Recursive Input Construction (ΨInput) v0

Goal: exercise `psiNormalize` and `runRecursiveTrace` in a fully deterministic, locally reproducible experiment using mocked ports and a `DeterministicLLM`.

Scope: single-file experiment described in the blueprint. No code files will be written by this experiment spec — contributors implement locally using pseudocode and mocks.

Prerequisites (for contributor)
- Node.js 18+ or compatible runtime; ability to run small TypeScript/JavaScript scripts.
- Familiarity with appending/reading `docs/BLUEPRINT.md` and recording outputs in a `ReplayStore` (file-based JSON is sufficient).

Experiment contract (inputs/outputs)
- Input: raw prompt string and optional `Σ_state` params (maxDepth, timeoutMs).
- Output: a `Φ_recursive_trace` JSON file saved to local `replays/` directory and a small human-readable summary printed to stdout.

Components & Mocks
- DeterministicLLM: returns pre-seeded replies based on prompt hash. Behavior: map(promptHash -> reply text, confidence, justification, cost).
- Mock EmbedPort: deterministic embedding function (e.g., hash-based numeric vector seeded by prompt).
- ReplayStore: local directory `replays/` where trace JSON files are written.

Experiment steps (runnable)
1. Setup
	 - Create a local project dir and `replays/` folder.
	 - Install minimal deps (e.g., node fetch if needed). Not required to run external calls.

2. Implement mocks (pseudocode)

// DeterministicLLM pseudocode
class DeterministicLLM {
	constructor(seedMap) { this.seedMap = seedMap; }
	run(spec) { const h = hash(spec.prompt); return this.seedMap[h] || {text: 'DUMMY', confidence:0.8, justification:{mock:true}}; }
}

// Mock EmbedPort pseudocode
function mockEmbed(text) { return hashVec(text, 16); }

3. Implement `psiNormalize` (use canonical Σ example in blueprint)
- Use provided `psiNormalize` pseudocode. Ensure `id`, `timestamp`, `context.tokens` (tokenize deterministically), and `params` are filled.

4. Implement `runRecursiveTrace(Σ, operators)`
- Operators: use two simple operators:
	- Ω_unfold: returns a set of subtasks (simulate by returning up to 2 subtasks derived from the prompt via simple templates).
	- Ω_fold: returns a compressed residue object and may set `converged` if a stop token appears.
- Loop behavior: for i in 0..Σ.params.maxDepth: select op alternately (unfold, simulate/fold), call op, push step symbol (with `createSymbol` pseudocode but write locally into the trace), merge state, check convergence.

5. Run experiment
- Seed `seedMap` for DeterministicLLM with 5 prompt-hash keys mapping to deterministic replies for steps.
- Run `psiNormalize(prompt)` to produce Σ.
- Call `runRecursiveTrace(Σ, [Ω_unfold, Ω_simulate, Ω_fold])` until converged or maxDepth.
- Save `Φ_recursive_trace` into `replays/<traceId>.json` and print a short summary: iterations, converged, finalStateHash, costTotal.

6. Verification checklist
- ReplayStore contains `<traceId>.json` and file includes `steps` array with deterministic text per the seedMap.
- Re-running the experiment with identical seedMap produces byte-for-byte identical `replays/<traceId>.json`.
- A simple `compare_traces` script should assert equality of the JSON files and exit 0.

Reproducibility notes
- Use stable hashing (e.g., SHA256) for prompt hashes and embed mock seeds.
- Record the exact `seedMap` JSON used to seed `DeterministicLLM` alongside the trace.

Safety & privacy
- Avoid using real PII in prompts. Use synthetic or redacted data.

Acceptance criteria
- Contributor can run the described steps and produce a replay file that matches the seedMap-driven expected replies.
- Document the experiment run in `docs/BLUEPRINT.md` by appending a short changelog entry (manual) indicating the contributor and trace filename.

Completed: Runnable experiment spec appended. I'll mark the `Convert top-priority unit to runnable experiment` todo completed and measure the file length.

## 1-Page Synthesis — Recursive Input Construction (distilled)

Core contract
- Input: free-text prompt + optional `Σ_state` params {maxDepth:int, timeoutMs:int, priority:low|med|high}.
- Process: deterministic normalization (`psiNormalize`), iterative symbolic expansion/contraction via `runRecursiveTrace`, deterministic operator scheduling, and per-step recording to `ReplayStore`.
- Output: `Φ_recursive_trace` JSON (ordered steps, symbols, costs, metadata) and a short human summary.

Top 5 priorities
1. Determinism & Replayability — implement `DeterministicLLM` and stable hashing so traces are byte-for-byte reproducible.
2. Minimal safe mocks — provide `Mock EmbedPort` and `Mock VectorStore` to avoid external calls in early experiments.
3. Trace hygiene & privacy — enforce redaction at `psiNormalize` and store PII-marked entries only as hashed references.
4. Clear operator primitives — standardize small set of Ω operators (unfold, simulate, fold, guard) with simple return shapes so tests/mocks can be reused.
5. Lightweight replay format — a compact JSON schema for `Φ_recursive_trace` with versioning and top-level provenance fields.

Duplication hotspots (quick scan)
- Multiple units re-specify DeterministicLLM behavior and mock ports — consolidate into a single `Mocks` annex.
- Repeated pseudocode for `psiNormalize` variants — pick canonical form and link others as variants.

Recommended next 4 actions
1. Land the runnable experiment scaffold (seedMap + DeterministicLLM + run script) in `docs/BLUEPRINT2.md` so contributors can paste and run quickly.
2. Author the tiny `compare_traces` script and a `replay-checklist` (3 checks) and place examples in `docs/BLUEPRINT.md` (append-only changelog references to runs).
3. Consolidate mock port definitions into one annex entry and update crosswalks to reference it.
4. Define a compact `Φ_recursive_trace` JSON schema (fields: traceId, seeds, steps[], finalStateHash, meta.version) and include sample minimal traces.

Acceptance snapshot (how to know this is done)
- A contributor follows `BLUEPRINT2.md` scaffold and produces `replays/trace-<id>.json` matching an included sample; `compare_traces` exits 0; a short changelog line appended to `docs/BLUEPRINT.md` references the trace file and contributor handle.

Next prioritized unit
- After synthesis: implement the `BLUEPRINT2.md` runnable scaffold and a microbenchmark harness for `psiNormalize` (Unit AI). These are high ROI and make experimentation fast and repeatable.

Appended the one-page synthesis (AC1). I'll count lines and mark the `Append one-page synthesis (AC1)` todo completed.

## Microbenchmark: psiNormalize (Unit AI)

Goal: provide a small, reproducible harness to measure latency of `psiNormalize` for short, medium, and long prompts using synthetic ports and deterministic tokenization.

Contract
- Input: prompt string, tokenizer function, params {maxDepth, concurrency}
- Output: timing metrics (ms) for each run, median/std across N runs, and a small JSON report saved to `benchmarks/psiNormalize-<ts>.json`.

Benchmark payloads
- Short: 16 tokens (e.g., "Summarize: plan step A, B, C")
- Medium: 128 tokens (paragraph-level problem description)
- Long: 1024 tokens (long context simulation: repeat paragraph templates)

Measurement harness (pseudocode, Node.js)

```js
import { psiNormalize } from './psiNormalize.js' // implement or import from your local code
import { deterministicTokenizer } from './mocks/tokenizer.js'
import { performance } from 'perf_hooks'

async function bench(prompt, runs=100){
	const times = [];
	for(let i=0;i<runs;i++){
		const start = performance.now();
		const Σ = psiNormalize(prompt, { tokenizer: deterministicTokenizer });
		const end = performance.now();
		times.push(end-start);
	}
	times.sort((a,b)=>a-b);
	const median = times[Math.floor(times.length/2)];
	const mean = times.reduce((s,x)=>s+x,0)/times.length;
	return { median, mean, runs };
}
```

Expected targets (initial)
- Short: median <= 30ms
- Medium: median <= 120ms
- Long: median <= 800ms

Synthetic tokenizer notes
- Use a deterministic, fast tokenizer (byte-pair or trivial whitespace + punctuation) for microbenchmarks to measure baseline algorithmic cost rather than model tokenization variance.

Reporting
- Save results as JSON with fields {payloadType, runs, median, mean, samples[], env:{node,os,ts}}
- Append a short human-readable summary to `docs/BLUEPRINT.md` with a one-line result and link to the JSON report.

Acceptance
- Team can run the harness locally and reproduce median numbers within 10% between runs on the same machine.

## Solo-run Replay Checklist & compare_traces examples

Purpose: short checklist and concrete commands for a single operator (you + AI) to run experiments, record replays, and verify deterministic outputs.

Checklist (solo)
1. Create working folder and files: `seedMap.json`, `deterministic_llm.js`, `run_trace.js`, `compare_traces.js`.
2. Run the scaffold once: `node run_trace.js "My test prompt"` — note the produced `replays/trace-<ts>.json` filename.
3. Save the produced trace path into your session notes and copy the `seedMap.json` used.
4. Re-run the same exact command twice (no edits) to produce a second trace file and compare them.
5. Use `compare_traces.js` to assert equality. If results differ, record the diff and the exact seedMap; then retry with the recorded seedMap.

PowerShell commands (copy-paste)
```powershell
# Run experiment (first run)
node run_trace.js "My test prompt"

# Re-run (second run)
node run_trace.js "My test prompt"

# Compare two most recent replays (example assumes the two filenames known)
node compare_traces.js .\replays\trace-<first>.json .\replays\trace-<second>.json
```

Naming convention & minimal logging
- Use `trace-<timestamp>` or `trace-<iso-ts>` for filenames. Immediately append a one-line changelog entry to `docs/BLUEPRINT.md` (manual) like: `2025-09-14: ran psiNormalize scaffold -> replays/trace-xyz (seedMap v1)`.

If mismatch
- If `compare_traces.js` reports `DIFFER`: open both JSONs, inspect `steps[]` text differences, then:
	1) Confirm `seedMap.json` used for both runs is identical.
	2) Confirm Node.js version and environment variables are unchanged.
	3) If still different, capture both JSON files and append a small diff block to `docs/BLUEPRINT.md` with `REPLAY-DIFF` header for record keeping.

Acceptance (solo)
- You can run the two-run compare and get `IDENTICAL` consistently for the scaffold with the provided `seedMap.json`.

## Replay-Checker: spec & Node.js pseudocode

Purpose: deterministically compare two `Φ_recursive_trace` JSON files while normalizing non-deterministic fields (timestamps, ids) and producing per-step diffs to help locate divergence points.

Checklist
- Input: path A, path B
- Behavior: load JSON, normalize fields (timestamp -> REDACTED, traceId -> REDACTED unless identical seeds), sort steps by index, canonicalize numeric formatting, then deep-compare structures printing a minimal per-step diff summary.
- Output: exit code 0 if identical after normalization, 1 if different, 2 on usage error. Also print a short human-readable report with first N diffs.

Normalization rules (recommended)
1. Replace ISO timestamps with `___TS___` constants.
2. Replace ephemeral IDs with `___ID___` unless they match between files and were derived from `seedMap` fields.
3. Round floats to 6 decimal places for comparison.
4. Sort arrays of steps by `i` before comparison.

Node.js pseudocode (ESM)

```js
import fs from 'fs';
import crypto from 'crypto';

function normalizeTrace(obj){
	// clone and normalize
	const copy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj));
	if(copy.traceId) copy.traceId = '___ID___';
	if(copy.meta && copy.meta.seedPrompt) copy.meta.seedPrompt = copy.meta.seedPrompt.replace(/\s+/g,' ').trim();
	if(Array.isArray(copy.steps)){
		copy.steps = copy.steps.sort((a,b)=>a.i - b.i).map(s => {
			const ns = {...s};
			if(ns.text) ns.text = ns.text.replace(/\s+/g,' ').trim();
			if(ns.embedding) ns.embedding = ns.embedding.map(x=>Number(x.toFixed(6)));
			return ns;
		});
	}
	return copy;
}

function deepEqual(a,b){ return JSON.stringify(a)===JSON.stringify(b); }

const [aPath,bPath] = process.argv.slice(2);
if(!aPath||!bPath){ console.error('usage: node replay_checker.js a.json b.json'); process.exit(2); }
const A = normalizeTrace(JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(aPath)));
const B = normalizeTrace(JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(bPath)));
if(deepEqual(A,B)){ console.log('IDENTICAL'); process.exit(0); }
console.log('DIFFER — showing first 5 step diffs');
for(let i=0;i<Math.min(5, Math.max(A.steps?.length||0,B.steps?.length||0)); i++){
	const as = A.steps?.[i] || null;
	const bs = B.steps?.[i] || null;
	if(JSON.stringify(as)!==JSON.stringify(bs)){
		console.log(`STEP ${i} A->`, as);
		console.log(`STEP ${i} B->`, bs);
	}
}
process.exit(1);
```

PowerShell example usage

```powershell
# Normalize & compare two traces
node replay_checker.js .\replays\trace-123.json .\replays\trace-124.json
```

Acceptance
- Running the replay-checker on two traces produced by the scaffold yields `IDENTICAL` when `seedMap.json` and prompt are identical and environment unchanged; otherwise it prints per-step diffs.
