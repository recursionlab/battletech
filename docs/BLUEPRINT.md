# Project Blueprint

This document centralizes the extracted blueprint derived from the `GAME_CHANGERS/` research corpus and related project files. Per user instructions, this will be the only file edited while building the blueprint.

## Goals

- Preserve and synthesize key concepts from the `GAME_CHANGERS/` research corpus.
- Map concepts to implementable software modules under `src/`.
- Provide milestones, data flows, and interfaces for staged implementation.
- Link to source documents in `GAME_CHANGERS/` for traceability.

## Scope

- Read-only synthesis of `GAME_CHANGERS/` files and other project metadata.
- No edits to existing files outside this document.

## Process

1. Read all files in `GAME_CHANGERS/` and extract themes.
2. Consolidate recurring concepts into core components.
3. Design architecture and data flow diagrams (conceptual).
4. Propose implementation milestones and tests.

## Current status

- File created. Ready to ingest summaries and notes from `GAME_CHANGERS/`.

## Citations

- Source corpus: `GAME_CHANGERS/` directory (multiple markdown files).
